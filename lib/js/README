This JavaScript Client can be used to integrate with the (mt) Public API.
This package includes example usages (mtapi.html) and a jquery plugin
(jquery.dump.js) for dumping javascript objects to json.

There are restrictions that prevent using this library from a domain other than
api.mediatemple.net, which may require some form of javascript proxy to get
around browser security issues.  See the following URL for more information on
solutions to this problem:

    http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/asp.net/calling-cross-domain-web-services-in-ajax/

However, more recent browsers which support Cross Origin Requests
(http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/), will be able to access the API without need for a
proxy.

To see the JavaScript client examples, open mtapi.html with a browser.  Set the
global DEBUG variable to true if you'd like to see console log messages
printed.
